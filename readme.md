# Spinnaker prototype

## Setup

- Fill in env-template with the necessary environment variables & chmod +x
- init and apply the following projects in order
    - kubernetes
    - platform
    - spinnaker

Note: There are still some hard coded values hanging out here and there. This means the terraform is not completely templatized via env vars. Sorry! Feel free to submit a PR!
